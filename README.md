....aka "G" because unless you are French the pronunciation of my
name will remain a mystery for eternity 😅 


## 🚀 About Me
Probably the only dev without a Twitter account. Tried it, didn't like it ¯¯\\_(ツ)__/¯¯
 
So, I'm stuck keeping up to date with old technologies like books and RSS feeds.

In another life, I worked in the Oil & Gas industry and lived in 4 countries (Kuwait, Qatar, Angola, Kenya).

For the next eight years, I pursued my own business in different domains related to health, wrote more than 150 articles, recorded more than 100 Youtube videos, and created 2 online courses.

**So, why change?**

Good question, glad you asked.

Well, coding has been in the back of my mind for almost 10 years but I never took the step. I don't want to live the rest of my life with regrets and decided to try it. **And I am absolutely in love with it!  😍**

I am an aspiring junior front-end developer who has learned the JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS stack and is ready to share his skills on cool projects to make the company thrive and continue to learn as much as possible.
