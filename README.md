## Bonjour 🥖🍷🧀, I'm Guillaume...
....aka "G" because unless you are French the pronunciation of my
name will remain a mystery for eternity.


## 🚀 About Me
Probably the only dev without a Twitter account. Tried it, didn't like it ¯¯\\_(ツ)__/¯¯
 
So I'm stuck keeping up to date with old technologies like books and RSS feeds.

In another life, I worked in the industry and lived in 4 differents countries (Kuwait, Qatar, Angola, Kenya).

Then for 8 years I did my own business in differents domains health related, built 3 websites, wrote more than 150 articles, recorded more than 100 Youtube videos and created 2 online courses.

**So why change?**

Good question, glad you asked.

Well, coding has been hitching me for almost 10 years but I never took the step. But I don't want to living the rest of my life with regrets and decided to jump into it. **And boy I love it !!!**

So today I'm an aspiring junior front-end developper who has leaned the `JavaScript`, `REACT`, `HTML` and `CSS` stack and is ready to share my skills on cool projects and keep learning as I do so.
