....aka "G" because unless you are French the pronunciation of my
name will remain a mystery for eternity 😅

## 🚀 About Me
Probably the only dev without a Twitter account. Tried it, didn't like it ¯¯\\_(ツ)__/¯¯
 
So, I'm stuck keeping up to date with old technologies like books and RSS feeds.

In another life, I worked in the Oil & Gas industry and lived in 4 countries (Kuwait, Qatar, Angola, Kenya).

For the last eight years, I pursued my own business in different domains related to health, wrote more than 150 articles, recorded more than 100 Youtube videos, and created 2 online courses.

> **So, why change?**

Good question, glad you asked.

Well, coding has been in the back of my mind for almost 10 years but I never took the step. I don't want to live the rest of my life with regrets and decided to try it. **And I am absolutely in love with it!  😍**

I learned JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS stack and today I feel ready to share my skills on cool projects to make your company thrive and continue to learn as much as possible.
